       "' \\n1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\\n\\nCompiled languages (like C, C++): Source code is translated into machine code before execution → faster runtime.\\n\\nInterpreted languages (like Python, JavaScript): Code is executed line by line by an interpreter → slower but more flexible.\\n\\n2. What is exception handling in Python?\\nException handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\\n\\n3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\\nThe finally block always executes, whether an exception occurs or not → useful for cleanup (e.g., closing files, releasing resources).\\n\\n4. What is logging in Python?\\nLogging records events, errors, or information during program execution, which helps in debugging and monitoring.\\n\\n5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\\n__del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). It is used to release resources.\\n\\n6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\\n\\nimport module → imports the whole module, need to use module.function().\\n\\nfrom module import function → imports only a specific function/class, can use directly.\\n\\n7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\\nBy using multiple except blocks or a tuple of exceptions:\\n\\ntry:\\n    # code\\nexcept (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\\n    print(e)\\n\\n\\n8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\\nIt ensures the file is automatically closed after operations, even if an exception occurs.\\n\\n9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\\n\\nMultithreading: Multiple threads within the same process → shares memory → better for I/O tasks.\\n\\nMultiprocessing: Multiple processes with separate memory → better for CPU-bound tasks.\\n\\n10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\\n\\nTracks errors and execution flow\\n\\nHelps debugging\\n\\nRecords runtime information\\n\\nSupports different levels of severity\\n\\n11. What is memory management in Python?\\nIt refers to how Python handles allocation and deallocation of memory automatically using garbage collection.\\n\\n12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\\n\\nWrap risky code in try.\\n\\nHandle errors in except.\\n\\n(Optional) Run else if no exception occurs.\\n\\n(Optional) Run finally for cleanup.\\n\\n13. Why is memory management important in Python?\\n\\nPrevents memory leaks\\n\\nImproves performance\\n\\nEnsures efficient use of system resources\\n\\n14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\\n\\ntry: Contains code that may raise an exception.\\n\\nexcept: Handles the error and prevents program crash.\\n\\n15. How does Python\\'s garbage collection system work?\\nPython uses reference counting + cyclic garbage collector to automatically free unused memory.\\n\\n16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\\nThe else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block.\\n\\n17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\\n\\nDEBUG\\n\\nINFO\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nERROR\\n\\nCRITICAL\\n\\n18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\\n\\nos.fork(): Available only on Unix/Linux, directly creates a child process.\\n\\nmultiprocessing: Cross-platform, higher-level API for creating and managing processes.\\n\\n19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\\n\\nReleases system resources\\n\\nSaves data properly\\n\\nPrevents file corruption\\n\\n20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\\n\\nread(): Reads the whole file or specified number of characters.\\n\\nreadline(): Reads a single line at a time.\\n\\n21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\\nIt is used to record logs, messages, and errors in a structured way (console, file, etc.).\\n\\n22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\\nIt allows interaction with the operating system → e.g., file operations, directory handling (os.remove(), os.rename(), os.path.exists()).\\n\\n23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\\n\\nCyclic references may delay garbage collection.\\n\\nLarge objects can cause memory leaks if not handled.\\n\\nManual resource management may still be needed.\\n\\n24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\\nUsing the raise keyword:\\n\\nraise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\\n\\n\\n25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\\n\\nImproves responsiveness in I/O-bound tasks (web scraping, network calls).\\n\\nRuns tasks concurrently without blocking.\\n\\nEfficient resource usage by sharing memory.\\n\\n'"
